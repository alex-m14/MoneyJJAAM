<h3 style="font-family:timesnewroman; color:#D47F17;"> Commonly Asked Questions </h3>
<h4> When do I need to pay back my student loans? </h4>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;"> You should begin paying your loans when you graduate, drop below half-time enrollment or leave school. Most of time, there is a six month grace period after one of these events in which you are required to start repaying your loan. PLUS loans do not have this grace period. </p>

<h4> What payment options do I have? </h4>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;"> Your loan provider will provide you with a payment plan. </p>

<p> If none of these options work for you, go to studentaid.gov <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans">studentaid.gov/manage</a> for more options or talk to your loan provider. </p>


<h4> How do I set up a payment plan? </h4>
<p> Your loan provider will contact you and set you up under the Standard Repayment Plan unless you choose a different plan. </p>
<p> If you schedule an automatic monthly electronic debit of your loan payment from your checking or savings account, you receive a 0.25% interest rate deduction on Direct Loans. You can make payments by mail too.</p>

<h4> Having trouble paying back your loans? </h4>
<p> Contact your provider immediately. You may be able to change your repayment plan to one that lowers your monthly payment and, in some cases, may be based on your income. </p>
